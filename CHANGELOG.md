## [0.1.0] - 2025-01-XX

### Added
- Initial release of ESO Live Encounter Log Sets & Abilities Analyzer
- Real-time monitoring of ESO encounter logs
- Comprehensive player analysis with skill line detection
- Front/back bar ability tracking
- Gear set identification using LibSets database
- Zone-based reporting system
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS)
- Test mode with sample log replay
- Comprehensive skill line mappings based on UESP
- Support for 634+ gear sets from LibSets database

### Features
- **Player Analysis**: Extracts player names, abilities, and gear information
- **Skill Line Detection**: Analyzes equipped abilities to infer skill lines (e.g., "Herald/Assassination/Winter's")
- **Gear Set Identification**: Uses LibSets database for accurate set identification
- **Zone Tracking**: Reports zone changes and maintains player data across encounters
- **Combat Event Handling**: Proper BEGIN_COMBAT/END_COMBAT event processing
- **Real-time Monitoring**: File system watchers for live log analysis
- **Test Mode**: Replay sample logs at various speeds for testing

### Technical Improvements
- **Robust CSV Parsing**: Handles complex ESO log format with nested arrays
- **Ability Cache System**: Efficient ability ID to name mapping
- **Combat Timeout Removal**: Eliminated unreliable timeout-based combat detection
- **Explicit Event Handling**: Uses BEGIN_COMBAT/END_COMBAT events for accurate combat tracking
- **Enhanced Skill Line Detection**: Comprehensive ability-to-skill-line mappings
- **LibSets Integration**: Full gear set database integration
- **Improved Display Format**: Cleaner, more concise output format

### Dependencies
- Python 3.7+
- watchdog (file system monitoring)
- click (command-line interface)
- pandas (Excel file processing)
- openpyxl (Excel file reading)
- colorama (cross-platform colored terminal output)

### Supported Platforms
- Windows 10/11
- macOS 10.14+
- Linux (experimental)

### Known Limitations
- Ability cache dependency on ABILITY_INFO events
- Limited to sets available in LibSets database
- Cannot identify builds for anonymous players
- ESO logs track 13 gear slots (missing backup off-hand weapon slot)

### Future Enhancements
- Web interface for real-time monitoring
- Historical encounter database
- Damage/healing number parsing
- Advanced build analysis
- Integration with ESO addons
